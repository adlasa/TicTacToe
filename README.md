# TicTacToe
A tic tac toe computer player based off the negamax algorithm.

I wrote this code in a couple hours after Thanksgiving as a challenge, so I apologize if it's a little hacky! As said before, the AI implementation is based off of the negamax algorithm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negamax. The program searches through the whole game tree so it's quite slow especially after the first move. I believe a better implementation would be to add alpha beta pruning to cut out elements of the game tree.
