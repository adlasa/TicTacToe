# TicTacToe
I wrote this code in a couple hours after Thanksgiving as a challenge, so I apologize if it's a little hacky! As said before, the AI implementation is based off of the negamax algorithm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negamax. The program searches through the whole game tree so it's quite slow especially for the first move. I believe a better implementation would be to add some sort of pruning, so the whole game tree isn't generated (stop after the first solved move, alpha beta pruning, etc.). Also, currently it doesn't pick the most optimal move. For example, if the program can win in one or two moves it might pick the two move solution as opposed to the quicker one.
